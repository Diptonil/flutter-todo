## Description

A simple one-screen todo app project to get bearings on Flutter. It just supports creation, updation and deletion of tasks (and checking them off), all the while providing local storage.


## Features

- Splashscreen.
- Database service for storing list items in Hive database.

That's... pretty much it (sighs).
